# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_

## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.
**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**

- The setting is in a kitchen or a bathroom, in front of a sink
- Anyone who wants to wash their hands -- preferably only one person is in front of the sink
- The actor is washing their hands in the sink
- The goal is to wash hands for longer than 30 seconds! (alternatively this could be done with brushing teeth for over 3 minutes)

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 
**Include a picture of your storyboard here**

![Storyboard](https://github.com/hgimonet/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/storyboard.jpeg?raw=true)

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.
**Summarize feedback you got here.**

Using color as a timer is a simplifcation, people will not be able to see their progress which could be frustrating.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

Having a single color for the entire 30 seconds is not very exciting. I wasn;t sure that it would matter that much, but I do think there should be a measure of progress.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

Figuring out whento have the progress light turn on it tricky - should it turn on when the hand intially get under the water or when they touch the soap? Initially I though the water but now the soap might be better.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 
**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**

The time lag between the controller and the device is a little distracting, but I love the concept otherwise! Could you also add a probe/blinking option? 

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

**Note:** Since I had some trouble initally with Tinkerbelle, I made my wizard setup with colored Post-It notes instead. It's not remote, but the wizard can simply remove the post-it notes when the time it right without saying anything to the actor. The wizard will be sitting out of sight (if Tinkerbell works out), with a timer in hand. Theu will change the colors when appropriate, either by changing the post-it notes, or the color on the Tinkerbelled phone.

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**

In this [video](https://github.com/hgimonet/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/wizard_setup_demo1.mp4), the actor attempts to wash their hands for 30 seconds:

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

**Show the follow-up work here.**

In this [video](https://github.com/hgimonet/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/wizard_setup_demo2.mp4), the actor attempts to wash their hands for **less than** 30 seconds:

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**

![Possible Designs](https://github.com/hgimonet/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/designs.jpg?raw=true)

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

The device should be waterproof, obviously, and there should be a sensor angled towards where people are most likely to wash their hands. I was thinking the device could be either mounted on the wall behind the sink, or onto the faucet. Ideally, there would be a light and a sensor mounted directly into the faucet (separate from the faucet sensor for having the hands underneath the faucet for water dispensing).

## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**

The interection can be viewed below:

**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

I want to thank Irene, Rui and Nicole for getting the creative juices flowing in class, and my husband Abraham for being my willing ~~test subject~~ test user!


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

**Document everything here.**

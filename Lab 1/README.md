# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_

## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## The Report

## Part A. Plan 

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**

- The setting is in a kitchen or a bathroom, in front of a sink
- Anyone who wants to wash their hands -- preferably only one person is in front of the sink
- The actor is washing their hands in the sink
- The goal is to wash hands for longer than 30 seconds! (alternatively this could be done with brushing teeth for over 3 minutes)

**Include a picture of your storyboard here**

![Storyboard](https://github.com/hgimonet/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/storyboard.jpeg?raw=true)

**Summarize feedback you got here.**

Using color as a timer is a simplifcation, people will not be able to see their progress which could be frustrating.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

Having a single color for the entire 30 seconds is not very exciting. I wasn;t sure that it would matter that much, but I do think there should be a measure of progress.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

Figuring out whento have the progress light turn on it tricky - should it turn on when the hand intially get under the water or when they touch the soap? Initially I though the water but now the soap might be better.

## Part C. Prototype the device


You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**

The time lag between the controller and the device is a little distracting, but I love the concept otherwise! Could you also add a probe/blinking option? 

## Part D. Wizard the device

**Note:** Since I had some trouble initally with Tinkerbelle, I made my wizard setup with colored Post-It notes instead. It's not remote, but the wizard can simply remove the post-it notes when the time it right without saying anything to the actor. The wizard will be sitting out of sight (if Tinkerbell works out), with a timer in hand. Theu will change the colors when appropriate, either by changing the post-it notes, or the color on the Tinkerbelled phone.

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**

In this [video](https://github.com/hgimonet/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/wizard_setup_demo1.mp4), the actor attempts to wash their hands for 30 seconds:

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

**Show the follow-up work here.**

In this [video](https://github.com/hgimonet/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/wizard_setup_demo2.mp4), the actor attempts to wash their hands for **less than** 30 seconds:

Finally, I have the actual setup with Tinkerbelle here:

## Part E. Costume the device

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**

Here are possible designs:

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

The device should be waterproof, obviously, and there should be a sensor angled towards where people are most likely to wash their hands. I was thinking the device could be either mounted on the wall behind the sink, or onto the faucet. Ideally, there would be a light and a sensor mounted directly into the faucet (separate from the faucet sensor for having the hands underneath the faucet for water dispensing).

## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**

The interection can be viewed below:

I want to thank Irene, Rui and Nicole for getting the creative juices flowing in class, and my husband Abraham for being my willing ~~test subject~~ test user!


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**

A standalone device would be cumbersome to charge, bulky and might fall off the sink, so my group suggested I integrate my device inside the faucet. They also mentioned that since children are very likely to not wash their hands for long enough, I should think about making the device fun and interactive -- almost everyone suggested I make the light shine through the water instead. Rui also suggested I use a gradient of colors to signal progress, while Irene suggested the added use of music to engage the user in the task of washing their hands. Nicole added that the device could also sense the cleanliness of hands and take that into account when signaling when to rinse.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

## Part A. Plan 

Irene, Nicole, Rui and I had a very fruitful discussion after discussing our feedback. As we were brainstorming ideas, it occured to me that that most alert systems are sound or light-based. I wonder if we could incorporate other senses, such as smell, touch, and even taste into the equation! This led me to imagine spinning off of Irene's concept of wellness breaks with a timed humidifier that is connected to a smart home. The humidifier would, every hour, start extruding a relaxing herbal smell, as well as turn yoga music on, and lower the lights in the room for a 5-minute relaxation session. This could be used by people who work from home, or even in their office, for long periods of time. There could even be a voice or a phone notification encouraging the user to stand up and perform some stretching exercises. It could also actually be used as an alarm, since people might either not hear well enough to wake up to a regular alarm, or could simply not respond to sound that well for waking up.

The goal is for a person to have a better experience of being alerted of something. The person could either be working an need intermittent breaks, or could be sleeping and need an alternative to horrible sound alarms. There would be two modes, interval mode and specific time mode. After setting up the alarm system, the person would either be reminded to stretch or woken up by sound, smell, and light.

**TODO: Summarize feedback you got here.**

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Acting this out, I realize the alarm system should be easy to turn on and off, and to switch between modes. I would imagine the user interface in that regard to be similar to a simplistic alarm clock, with the added interval/time toggle button. The device should also be easily moved from a place to another, so it can be taken from a bedroom to an office depending on the need. Acting this through, I realized that having either one device with a lightbuld, an infuser and a sounds system all together might be easier to set up than a device that hooks up to the lights and the sounds system in one's house, even if it is a IoT house.

There is also the concern of timing for each aspect of the device - should they all start together, or be staggered? Initially I thought everything should start together, but acting it out, I actually think having the infuser start first, then the light, slowly building brightness, then the sounds would be best. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

## Part D. Wizard the device

See the prototype [here](https://youtu.be/5pBqzC66W-Y).

Since I do not have a smell-prdocuing device, I have simply put essential oils on a flab of the cartboad in the costume. The wizard will have to manually open it (I tried doing it with a string but that ended up tipping the whole thing over...)

At the alert time, the wizard will:
1) open the smell-latch
2) turn the light on incrementally
3) play the gong sound

## Part E. Costume the device

It should look soothing, and be easy to carry around from one place to another.
